# Introduction

The game is titled "Beats and Bones" and is a retro 8bit style adventure game where you complete rhythym challenges instead of hacking and slashing your way to victory.

This was the first game I have ever made using Godot, and also the first game I've ever completed during a game jam, so expectations should be set accordingly. :)
