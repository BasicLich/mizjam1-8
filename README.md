# Introduction

The game is titled "Beats and Bones" and is a retro 8bit style adventure game where you complete rhythym challenges instead of hacking and slashing your way to victory.
This was the first game I have ever made using Godot, and also the first game I've ever completed during a game jam, so expectations should be set accordingly. :)

I didn't have time to find 8bit music and assign specific rhythym courses to each song, so I just procedurally generated the beats and play a bass/snare sound to keep the tempo.
It might be hard for people that aren't musically inclined to follow, but it's all I had time for.

**Game rules**

- You can end the game at any time by finding your dog and running to them, the dog will spawn in a few different places throughout the map
- Score more points by collecting more bones, and getting more beats by challenging enemies
- Don't miss too many beats, or it will be game over
- You can try to dodge the enemies if you don't want to challenge them

**How long does a playthrough take?**

If you run around just looking for the dog, probably about 5 minutes. If you want to explore the whole map and collect most of the bones, probably 20-30min.
